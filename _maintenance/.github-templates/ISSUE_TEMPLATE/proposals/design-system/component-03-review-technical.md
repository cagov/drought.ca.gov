### Features
*Critical features to support initially.*

### Data structure
*If this component maps to an existing schema.org microdata format, please include. If it doesnt, that's ok. We will look it up and provide a data structure. We use schema.org for SEO and data management and round-trip data migration to help keep the component upgradable.*

### Format
* Include or reference the expected HTML markup and CSS output (if known)*

### Accessibility
*In our design system, we are creating fully-accessible components, for delivery and for the editor experience. We have a [baseline]() of general accessibility practices we are following. Are there any additional accessibility considerations with this component?* 

### Analytics
*How can we measure if this component is succeeding in its intention, or discover new insights about needs that we did not know?*

### Performance
*We provide a [baseline]() of tests for basic performance. Will this component present additional performance issues, and if so, how can we address them?*

### Testing plan
*We provide a [baseline]() of tests for basic component features. Are there additional tests that need to happen for this component?*

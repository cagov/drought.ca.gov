# Component Metadata

A component proposal for the design system needs a metadata recommendation.

Our design system uses package control systems, and these systems need names and some basic metadata about the component, and will help with registering the component in the documentation and any libraries.

## Component Metadata Checklist
- [ ] Component name
- [ ] Short name
- [ ] Version number
- [ ] Destination
- [ ] Description

### Name of component
*What should we call this component in the design system? The name originally proposed might not follow our naming conventions, or may have a conflict.*

### Short name
*What should the computer call this component? (alpha-numeric characters, dash separated, e.g. "highlight-box")* 

### Version number
*Start at v1.0.0, if this is a proposal for a new version, please say so.*

### Description

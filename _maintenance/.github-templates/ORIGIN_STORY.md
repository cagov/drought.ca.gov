# Origin story

* Created to help with onboarding new team members.
* Realized we needed some templates to help improve the quality of our Github.
* Chach did a presentation for a team Lunch & Learn where she dug into the history of READMEs, especially READMEs in government - and some thoughts from documentation experts Daniel Beck and Amelia Winger-Bearskin, a need to create templates for the California Design System, some guidance from the Foundation for Public Code on linking code to policy and government teams, and observations as a new State employee. There is an opportunity to improve the context we are sharing and make exemplary public github repositories for State governments.

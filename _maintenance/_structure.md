## Files which will remain in this repo
* `/wordpress` content is written here by our publishing service from the WordPress API. This will continue to happen. These files will not be manually modified in this repo.
* `/src/templates` contains the headless versions of page templates, that code will continue to be managed manually in this repo. The data in the templates should be generated by the WordPress API data: the contents of the menus is already pulled from the API for example.

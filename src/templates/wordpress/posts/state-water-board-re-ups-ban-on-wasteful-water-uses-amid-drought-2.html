<p>As drought conditions continue throughout the state, the State Water Resources Control Board <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2022/pr12092022-water-waste-prohibitions-readoption.pdf">readopted an emergency regulation</a> that bolsters Californiaâ€™s conservation efforts by prohibiting wasteful water practices like watering lawns when it rains. The regulation was originally adopted in January 2022 and is now extended until January 2024. It applies to all water users.</p>

<p>The Department of Water Resources (DWR) today conducted the first snow survey of the season at Phillips Station, which recorded 55.5 inches of snow depth and a snow water equivalent of 17.5 inches, which is 177% of average for this location. Conditions so far this season have proven to be strikingly similar to last year when California saw some early rainstorms and strong December snow totals only to have the driest January through March on record.</p>

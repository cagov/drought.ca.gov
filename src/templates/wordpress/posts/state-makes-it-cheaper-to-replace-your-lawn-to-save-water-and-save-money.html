<p>Californians can now get more money to replace their lawns with drought-resistant plants and landscaping thanks to a <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/09/28/california-is-making-it-cheaper-to-replace-your-lawn-to-save-water-and-save-money/">new law</a> signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/09/28/california-is-making-it-cheaper-to-replace-your-lawn-to-save-water-and-save-money/">legislation</a> exempts local rebates for turf replacement from state income tax.</p>

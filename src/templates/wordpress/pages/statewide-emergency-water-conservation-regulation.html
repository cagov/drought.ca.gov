<p>A new statewide emergency water conservation regulation that bans using potable (drinkable) water on decorative or non-functional grass at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties – including areas of nonfunctional turf under homeowners’ association control – went into effect on June 10. It also requires urban water suppliers to implement all demand-reduction actions under Level 2 of their Water Shortage Contingency Plans.</p>

<h2>Funding programs</h2>

<h3>Immediate drought relief</h3>

<p>In response to current drought conditions, the California Legislature authorized $500 million for the California Department of Water Resources to provide funding for interim or immediate relief. Read more at DWR&#8217;s <a href="https://water.ca.gov/Water-Basics/Drought/Drought-Funding">Drought Funding</a> page.</p>

<h3>Drought relief for small communities and Tribes</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://water.ca.gov/Water-Basics/Drought/Small-Community-Drought-Relief">Small Community Drought Relief Program</a> helps communities and eligible Tribes that are not served by an urban water supplier. We define this as one that supplies at least 3,000 connections or 3,000 acre-feet of water per year. Small community water systems and Tribes under drought emergency should apply as soon as possible. Submit applications or questions to <a href="mailto:smallcommunitydrought@water.ca.gov">smallcommunitydrought@water.ca.gov</a>.</p>

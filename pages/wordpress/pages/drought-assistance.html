<h2>Emergency programs</h2>

<h3>Drinking water for drought relief</h3>

<p>The state pays for getting bottled and hauled water to areas that need immediate drought relief. This is managed through your county&#8217;s Office of Emergency Services (OES). Learn more at the <a href="https://www.caloes.ca.gov/home">CalOES website</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding programs</h2>

<h3>Drought relief for small communities</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/small-community-drought-relief-program/">Small Community Drought Relief Program</a> helps communities that are not served by an urban water supplier. This is defined as one that supplies at least 3,000 connections or 3,000 acre-feet of water per year.&nbsp;Small communities under drought emergency should apply as soon as possible. Submit applications or questions to <a href="mailto:SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov">SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>Water efficiency on farms and ranches</h3>

<p>The State Water Efficiency and Enhancement Program (SWEEP) is a program for California farmers and ranchers. It funds projects that save water by increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems. Get more details and apply at CDFA’s <a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/oefi/sweep/">SWEEP</a> webpage.</p>

<h3>Drought relief for urban spaces and tribal lands</h3>

<p>The Urban/Multibenefit Drought Relief Grant Program will offer financial help to drought relief projects that:</p>

<ul><li>Impact health and human safety</li><li>Impact fish and wildlife</li><li>Restore water to those who are threatened with water loss or contamination</li></ul>

<p>Many entities that provide water will be eligible to apply. Applications will be accepted starting in late October. See details at the <a href="/urban-multibenefit-program" data-type="URL" data-id="/urban-multibenefit-program">Urban/Multibenefit Drought Relief Grant Program</a> page.</p>

<h3>Water projects for disadvantaged communities</h3>

<p>Urgent Drinking Water/Cleanup &amp; Abatement Account Programs fund water projects which benefit disadvantaged communities. They address the lack of reliable water supplies for these communities due to drought and other emergency situations. Public agencies, tribal governments, non-profits, and community water systems may apply. Find details and how to apply at the <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/caa/">Cleanup &amp; Abatement Account</a> webpage.</p>

<h2>Conservation programs</h2>

<h3>Water availability monitoring and management</h3>

<p>During drought, the State Water Board&#8217;s Division of Water Rights issues a series of notices to water right holders when water supplies begin to decline. This system manages diversions when there is limited water supply. Read more about these notices at the <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/">Division of Water Rights</a> webpage.</p>

<h3>Temporary changes to water rights terms</h3>

<p>When approved, Temporary Urgency Change Petitions (TUCPs) let water right holders temporarily deviate from their existing terms to get relief from drought conditions. Temporary urgency change orders last up to 180 days and are renewable. Read more at <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/drought/docs/infosheets/infosheet_tucp.pdf">TUCP Information and Guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>All water right diverters must measure and report their water use. This ensures limited supplies are allocated fairly. See how this is enforced at <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/enforcement/compliance/">Compliance Monitoring Programs</a>.</p>

<h3>Conservation and efficiency</h3>

<p>Adopting water efficiency standards better prepares us for drought. It reduces the energy needed to pump, transport, treat, and deliver water. Learn more at the <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/">Water Conservation Portal</a>.</p>

<h3>Monthly conservation and production reports</h3>

<p>These reports from urban water suppliers let us know how much water the state is using and saving. This leads to better near-term decision-making. Find out more at <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/conservation_reporting.html">Water Conservation and Production Reports</a>.</p>

<p>After two exceptionally dry winters, California is once again experiencing drought conditions.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how the state is taking action:</p>

<ul><li>We’re giving agencies the tools they need to tackle the drought emergency.</li><li>We’re addressing long-standing water challenges.</li><li>And we’re securing vital and limited water supplies to sustain our state into the future.</li></ul>

<p>Since our last major drought (2012-16), California is much less vulnerable to drought. State agencies provided key lessons in a&nbsp;<a href="https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Water-Basics/Drought/Files/Publications-And-Reports/CNRA-Drought-Report-final-March-2021.pdf">comprehensive report</a>.</p>

<h2>New actions</h2>

<h3>Expanded drought emergency</h3>

<p>On May 10, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/05/10/governor-newsom-expands-drought-emergency-to-klamath-river-sacramento-san-joaquin-delta-and-tulare-lake-watershed-counties/">expanded the drought emergency proclamation</a>&nbsp;to include new areas. It now includes counties in the Klamath River, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Tulare Lake Watershed. This action was necessary&nbsp;to protect public health, safety, and the environment. In total, the&nbsp;drought state of emergency now covers 41 counties, where 30% of the state’s population lives.</p>

<p>Governor Newsom also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/05/10/governor-newsom-announces-5-1-billion-package-for-water-infrastructure-and-drought-response-as-part-of-100-billion-california-comeback-plan/">proposed a&nbsp;$5.1 billion package&nbsp;</a>of investments for drought response and water resilience. This package would:</p>

<ul><li>Address immediate emergency needs</li><li>Build regional capacity to endure drought, and</li><li>Safeguard water supplies for communities, the economy and the environment.</li></ul>

<h3>Proclaimed drought emergency</h3>

<p>On April 21, 2021, Governor Newsom proclaimed a <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Emergency-Proclamation-1.pdf">drought emergency</a>. This lets the state respond to water supply shortfalls where conditions are extremely dry. It covered the Russian River Watershed of Sonoma and Mendocino counties.</p>

<h3>Supported local and regional efforts</h3>

<p>In April 2019, Governor Newsom ordered state agencies to prepare a <a href="https://waterresilience.ca.gov/">Water Resilience Portfolio</a>. This helps California’s diverse regions endure drought, flood, and changing precipitation patterns. The state released the implementation of the Portfolio in July 2020. It supports local and regional efforts to meet community, economic, and environmental needs in the face of climate change.</p>

<h3>Convened interagency taskforce</h3>

<p>The Governor has convened a broad team from many agencies to prepare for drought. This helps the state quickly protect communities, economic activity, and the natural environment.</p>

<p>The Drought Resilience Taskforce reports to the Governor’s Office. It includes the following departments and agencies:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>California Department of Food and Agriculture</li><li>California Environmental Protection Agency<ul><li>State Water Resources Control Board</li></ul></li><li>California Health and Human Services Agency</li><li>California Labor and Workforce Development Agency</li><li>California Natural Resources Agency<ul><li>Department of Water Resources</li><li>Department of Fish and Wildlife</li></ul></li><li>California Public Utilities Commission</li><li>Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development</li><li>Governor’s Office of Emergency Services</li><li>Governor’s Office of Planning and Research</li></ul>

<p>The Taskforce meets regularly to coordinate and direct state response to the drought. It engages key partners to plan, coordinate, and collaborate on necessary drought-related actions. Those partners include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Federal, tribal and local governments</li><li>Local water agencies and irrigation districts</li><li>Agriculture producers and associations</li><li>Community-based organizations and environmental justice groups, and</li><li>Environmental conservation organizations and conservancies.</li></ul>

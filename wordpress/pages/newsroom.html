          <strong>April 21, 2021 </strong>&#8211; With much of the West
          experiencing drought conditions and California squarely in a second
          consecutive dry year, Governor Gavin Newsom today directed state
          agencies to take immediate action to bolster drought resilience and
          prepare for impacts on communities, businesses and ecosystems if dry
          conditions extend to a third year.

            <strong>April 1, 2021</strong>&#8211; DWR conducted the fourth snow survey
            at the Phillips Station snow course. The manual survey recorded 49.5 inches of
            snow depth and a snow water equivalent of 21 inches, which is 83 percent of
            average for this location.

<p>California is facing significant drought across the state. So it&#8217;s time we cut back on our water consumption even more. Whether it’s inside or outside your home, small changes can save 10 to 100 gallons of water a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the top ways to conserve water:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="list-highlight"><li>Improve landscape irrigation<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">50% of residential water use goes to outdoor irrigation. Lots of water is lost through evaporation, wind, or runoff. Efficient irrigation can prevent this water loss. Water one day less per week and use a weather-based irrigation controller. This can save up to 8,800 gallons every year.</span></li><li>Fix leaks<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Take time to check water connections inside and outside your home to ensure there are no leaks. This can save up to 110 gallons of water each month.</span></li><li>Wash full loads of clothes and dishes<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Before starting your washer or dishwasher, double-check that it is completely full. This will save 15-45 gallons of water per load of clothes and 5-15 gallons per load of dishes.</span></li><li>Take 5-minute showers<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">A 5-minute shower can save 12.5 gallons per shower when using a water-efficient showerhead.</span></li><li>Set mower blades to 3&#8243;<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Next time you mow your lawn, change the mower blade setting to 3 inches. This will encourage deeper roots and save 16-50 gallons of water per day.</span></li><li>Use a broom to clean outdoor areas<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">With dry conditions comes more dust. Instead of using a hose to spray down your patios and walkways, use a broom instead. This can save 8-18 gallons of water every minute.</span></li><li>Turn off water when brushing teeth or shaving<br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">These daily tasks don’t need water to run the whole time. Get in the habit of turning off the tap. Teach little ones to do so as a water conservation way of life. This way, you can save 10 gallons of water per person per day.</span></li><li>Fill bathtubs halfway or less<br>Filling your bathtub halfway or less can save 12 gallons of water per bath.</li></ul>

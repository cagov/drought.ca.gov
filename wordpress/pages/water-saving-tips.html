<p>California is facing significant drought across the state. So it&#8217;s time we cut back on our water consumption even more. Whether it’s inside or outside your home, small changes can save 10 to 100 gallons of water a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the top 5 ways to conserve water:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fix leaks</h2>

<p>Take time to check water connections inside and outside your home to ensure there are no leaks. This can save up to 110 gallons of water each month.</p>

<h2>Set mower blades to 3&#8243;</h2>

<p>Next time you mow your lawn, change the mower blade setting to 3 inches. This will encourage deeper roots and save 16-50 gallons of water per day.</p>

<h2>Use a broom to clean outdoor areas</h2>

<p>With dry conditions comes more dust. Instead of using a hose to spray down your patios and walkways, use a broom instead. This can save 8-18 gallons of water every minute.</p>

<h2>Wash full loads of clothes and dishes</h2>

<p>Before starting your washer or dishwasher, double-check that it is completely full. This will save 15-45 gallons of water per load of clothes and 5-15 gallons per load of dishes.</p>

<h2>Turn off water when brushing teeth or shaving</h2>

<p>These daily tasks don’t need water to run the whole time. Get in the habit of turning off the tap. Teach little ones to do so as a water conservation way of life. This way, you can save 10 gallons of water per person per day.</p>

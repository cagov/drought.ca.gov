<p>Water is a sacred and important resource to many tribal nations. It is vital to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Tribal subsistence</li><li>Cultural practices</li><li>Health and welfare</li><li>Agricultural production, and&nbsp;</li><li>Community and economic development.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>The state partners with California Native American tribes to manage drought conditions and emergencies. In doing so, we respect tribal sovereignty and traditional drought resilience strategies.</p>

<h2>Tribal drought declarations</h2>

<p>Tribes can submit drought declarations and requests for support by email. In your email, include:</p>

<ul><li>The name of your tribe</li><li>The best point(s) of contact for the tribal government</li><li>Any requests for support from the State of California, and</li><li>Any questions.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Attach a signed letter, declaration, or resolution from the tribal council or chairperson. It should declare a drought emergency for the tribal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Email your declaration and request for support to <strong><a href="mailto:drought-tribal-lands@digital.ca.gov">drought-tribal-lands@digital.ca.gov</a>.</strong> You can also ask for updated information, make requests, or send questions to this email.</p>

<h2>State drought resources for tribes</h2>

<h3>Tribal Nation Grant Fund – Emergency Response Grant</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://tngf.ca.gov/emergency_response_grant.html">Tribal Nation Grant Fund &#8211; Emergency Response Grant</a> is available to eligible tribes. It responds to emergencies that threaten the health and safety of tribal communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tribes may apply for up to $100,000 per emergency. They must provide an authorizing resolution and a tribal emergency resolution/proclamation. Funding is ongoing and is typically considered on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Grant funds may be used to:</p>

<ul><li>Fund programs,&nbsp;</li><li>Buy supplies, and</li><li>Give relief for situations that threaten the health and safety of tribal communities.</li></ul>

<h3>Small Community Drought Relief Grant Program</h3>

<p>The Small Community Drought Relief Grant Program focuses on emergency needs of water systems. It is a program of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the State Water Board. The program helps communities make their drinking water solutions sustainable. It increases community resilience to drought and other conditions caused by climate change.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Work-With-Us/Grants-And-Loans/Small-Community-Drought-Relief/Small-Community-Drought-Relief-Guidelines_2021.pdf">DWR Guidelines</a>&nbsp;for how small water systems may apply for funds as part of this program. To get a grant, projects must serve small communities in counties under drought emergency. Small communities affected by drought should apply as soon as possible. Submit applications or questions to <a href="mailto:SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov">SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience (SAFER)</h3>

<p>California’s Human Right to Water law declares that:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.” </em> (<em>Cal. Water Code § 106.3</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/safer/">SAFER</a> aims to quickly deliver enough safe and affordable drinking water to Californians who need it. It ensures that water systems establish sustainable short-term and long-term solutions. This minimizes unfair environmental burdens experienced by some communities. It advances water justice for people of all incomes, races, and cultures.</p>

<h2>Federal funding opportunities</h2>

<p>The BRIC program makes federal funds available for hazard mitigation activities. States, U.S. territories, federally-recognized tribal governments, and local communities are eligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Extreme weather events and chronic stressors are expected to increase in the future. We need natural hazard mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation and resilience.</p>

<h2>Cultural uses of water</h2>

<p>In 2017, the State Water Board established Tribal Beneficial Uses. It is a group of beneficial ways that Native American cultures use California waters. This can include recreation, navigation, and the consumption of non-commercial fish or shellfish. Tribal Beneficial Uses are also called “cultural uses of water.”</p>

<p>Tribal Beneficial Uses give a water quality safety measure that considers these specific uses of water tribes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More information is available at <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/about_us/public_participation/tribal_affairs/beneficial_uses.html">Tribal Beneficial Uses – Cultural Uses of Water</a>. Also read there how tribes and tribal communities can take part in basin planning.</p>

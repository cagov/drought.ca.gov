<p>Emergency water is available to households, small water systems, and community water systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contact your county&#8217;s OES if you have a water outage, shortage, or dry well. They will determine what help is available and how to get it to you.</p>

<p>The drought is an evolving emergency. The State will adapt its response as needs change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More help for households</h2>

<p>Some counties are struggling to help their residents deal with the impact of drought. If your county OES is unable to assist you, email <a href="mailto:drought@waterboards.ca.gov">drought@waterboards.ca.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>Steps for community water systems</h2>

<p>Community water systems serve more than 15 service connections or 25 residents. Getting emergency water to a community water system requires a few extra steps. Here&#8217;s how to get help:</p>

<ol><li>Follow the steps in your system’s water shortage contingency plan.</li><li>Contact your county&#8217;s OES to request help. They will determine what help is available and how to get it to you.</li><li>Alert your district engineer or local primary agency (LPA) to the issue.<ol><li>If the State Water Board regulates your system, contact your <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/documents/ddwem/DDWdistrictofficesmap.pdf">district engineer</a>.</li><li>If your county regulates your system, contact your <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/programs/documents/web_contact_info_district_lpa.pdf">LPA</a>.</li></ol></li></ol>

<h2>Small community grants&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://link">Small Community Drought Relief Program</a> helps communities that are not served by an urban water supplier. This is defined as one that supplies at least 3,000 connections or 3,000 acre-feet of water per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get a grant, a project must serve communities like this in counties under drought emergency. Small communities affected by drought are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. Submit applications or questions to <a href="mailto:SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov">SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov</a>.</p>

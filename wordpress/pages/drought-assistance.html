<h2>Funding programs</h2>

<h3>Drought relief for small communities</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/small-community-drought-relief-program/">Small Community Drought Relief Program</a> helps communities that are not served by an urban water supplier. We define this as one that supplies at least 3,000 connections or 3,000 acre-feet of water per year. Small community water systems under drought emergency should apply as soon as possible. Submit applications or questions to <a href="mailto:SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov">SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>Water efficiency on farms and ranches</h3>

<p>The State Water Efficiency and Enhancement Program (SWEEP) is a program for California farmers and ranchers. It funds projects that save water by increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems.

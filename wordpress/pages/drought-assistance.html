<h2>Small community grants</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/small-community-drought-relief-program/">Small Community Drought Relief Program</a> helps communities that are not served by an urban water supplier. This is defined as one that supplies at least 3,000 connections or 3,000 acre-feet of water per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get a grant, a project must serve communities like this in counties under drought emergency. Small communities affected by drought are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. Submit applications or questions to <a href="mailto:SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov">SmallCommunityDrought@water.ca.gov</a>.</p>
